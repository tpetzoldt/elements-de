<!--
## Introduction
-->

This website contains a collection of material for introductory statistics 
courses with **R**. The aim is to provide insight in fundamental principles and 
an overview to enable students to select and understand specialized books 
and online material to dig in deeper in the diverse and fascinating field of 
statistical computing.

The corresponding lab exercises are found at [https://tpetzoldt.github.io/element-labs/](https://tpetzoldt.github.io/element-labs/).

## Status

The selection of topics reflects what I think is useful as door-opener into 
various fields, useful in ecology and aquatic sciences. It is an ongoing project 
based on former PDF slides and other course material, constructive comments and 
suggestions for improvement are welcome.
